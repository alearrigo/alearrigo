I am a data scientist currently doing freelance consultancy. Here is some information about my (admittedly, non-contiguous) professional interests.

Iâ€™ve always been interested in international startup scene and how technology can be leveraged for sustainable economic and social development. Previously, I co-founded a VC-backed startup called dexlab.io operating in open finance and cryptocurrencies spaces.

Recently, I have been working as a consultant mainly in psychometrics, using several established tools and methods and exploring the paradigmatic revolution of dynamical network analysis in psychological constructs.

Currently living in Italy, I lived in Berlin for a while.
